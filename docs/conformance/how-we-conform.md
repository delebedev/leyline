# How We Conform

**The single reference for conformance workflow.** Supersedes command references in `pipeline.md` and `workflow.md` for the match-door protocol layer. Those docs retain architectural context and protocol findings — this doc tells you what to run.

## Principles

1. **Recording is the spec.** Real server recordings are the source of truth.
2. **Raw proto, not decoded JSON.** `md-frames.jsonl` is lossy — use `RecordingFrameLoader` for conformance.
3. **Observe variance, don't guess from one sample.** Run `just segment-variance` to see what's constant vs variable.
4. **Structural invariants, not field-by-field equality.** The relationship catalog encodes the protocol rules. The differ uses variance profiles to compare intelligently.

## Quick Reference

| I want to... | Run |
|---|---|
| See what the real server sends for a message type | `just conform-proto SearchReq <session> --seat 0` |
| See field variance across all recordings for a mechanic | `just segment-variance CastSpell` |
| List all segment categories with instance counts | `just segment-variance` |
| Validate structural invariants against recordings | `just segment-relationships` |
| Validate structural invariants against engine output | `just segment-relationships --engine <dir>` |
| Diff engine output against a recording (exact) | `just conform-proto <Type> <session> --engine <dir>` |
| Diff engine output against a recording (profile-aware) | `just conform-proto <Type> <session> --engine <dir> --profile` |
| Check annotation detail key shapes | `just proto-annotation-variance` |
| Interactive segment exploration (legacy, JSON-based) | `just tape segment list <session>` |

## Workflow: Implementing a New Mechanic

### 1. Observe

Before writing any code, understand what the real server does:

```bash
# What categories exist in your recordings?
just segment-variance

# Detailed profile for the mechanic you're implementing
just segment-variance CastSpell

# Full proto decode of a specific message
just conform-proto SearchReq 2026-03-21_22-05-00 --seat 0
```

The variance report tells you:
- Which annotations are always/sometimes present
- Which fields are constant vs variable
- Co-occurrence patterns between annotation types
- affectorId rules (auto-derived from data)

### 2. Implement

Write the code based on what the variance report says, not on one recording sample.

Key inputs from the observatory:
- **CONSTANT fields** → hardcode the value
- **ENUM fields** → use the observed value set
- **ID fields** → wire instance ID resolution
- **Always-present annotations** → must produce them
- **Sometimes annotations** → produce them when the condition applies

### 3. Verify

After implementation, capture engine output and validate:

```bash
# Run a puzzle that exercises the mechanic
./gradlew :matchdoor:testIntegration -Pkotest.filter.specs=".*EngineRelationshipTest"

# Validate relationships against engine output
just segment-relationships --engine matchdoor/build/conformance/engine-multi/

# Profile-aware diff against a specific recording
just conform-proto <Type> <session> --engine <dir> --profile
```

The relationship validator checks:
- Hand-written catalog (structural rules like "CastSpell always has ObjectIdChanged")
- Auto-derived affectorId rules (computed fresh from available recordings — count scales with data)

### 4. Grow the catalog

When you find a new bug, ask: "what structural rule would have caught this?" Add it to `RelationshipCatalog.kt`. Run `just segment-relationships` to confirm it holds against recordings. The next engineer won't hit the same bug.

## Card-Centric Workflow

The mechanic-centric workflow above works bottom-up: pick a protocol segment, observe variance, implement. The card-centric workflow works top-down: pick a card, decompose it into mechanics, trace it on the wire, find gaps, then group gaps into horizontal work.

### 1. Record — play diverse games

Build mechanic-dense decks (`just deck coverage <SETS>`) and play proxy sessions. The goal is mechanic variety per game, not wins. Every card resolved = data point.

### 2. Spec — one card at a time

Use the `card-spec` skill. For each card: read the Forge script, decompose into mechanics, trace zone transitions and annotations from recordings, identify what's missing in leyline.

Specs live in `docs/card-specs/<card>.md`. Each is self-contained: identity, mechanics table (with Forge event + catalog status), plain-English behavior, trace, annotations, gaps, supporting evidence.

### 3. Synthesize — slice horizontally

After a batch of card specs, read all gaps across specs and group by shared infrastructure:

| Horizontal layer | Example | Cards unblocked |
|-----------------|---------|-----------------|
| Counter type mapper | incubation=200, landmark=127, bore=182 | Drake Hatcher, Treasure Map, Brass's Tunnel-Grinder |
| Token grpId registry | Clue=89236, Hero=96212, Drake=94163 | Novice Inspector, Black Mage's Rod, Drake Hatcher |
| Transform (grpId mutation) | silent in-place swap, no annotation | Treasure Map, Brass's Tunnel-Grinder, all DFCs |
| Cast-from-non-hand | GY→Stack, Exile→Stack | Think Twice, Ratcatcher Trainee, Cauldron Familiar |
| AbilityWordActive | threshold, descended | Kiora, Brass's Tunnel-Grinder |

Each horizontal layer becomes a focused PR with unit tests. Cross-link back to the card specs that need it.

### 4. Implement — horizontal layers first, card puzzles as gates

```
horizontal PR (unit-tested)     card puzzle (integration gate)
─────────────────────────────   ──────────────────────────────
counter type mapper             Drake Hatcher puzzle
token grpId registry            Novice Inspector puzzle
transform handler               Treasure Map puzzle
cast-from-GY action             Think Twice puzzle
```

Each horizontal PR is small, testable, independently mergeable. The card puzzle proves the pieces compose correctly end-to-end. A puzzle failing tells you which horizontal layer has a gap.

### 5. Close the loop

After a card works in a puzzle, playtest it via `just serve` + Arena. Record the session. Compare the leyline output against the real-server trace in the card spec. Differences = conformance bugs → new gaps → next iteration.

Update the card spec with "verified" status and link to the PR that made it work.
